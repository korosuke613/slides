# korosuke613.dev

- Hirakiba website
- I created this as a place to organize my output, links to SNS, and other information.
- Composed of Astro + React (second generation)
  - (aside) The first generation was configured with Nuxt + Vue
  - (Aside) Migration to Nuxt3 was too hard, so we had to rebuild with a newer framework + React, which we use in our work.

<br>

### What is Astro?

> Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.
>
> https://docs.astro.build/ja/getting-started/ „Çà„Çä

- Adopt MPA (Multi Page Application)
- High speed because it is designed to reduce JS execution on the client as much as possible
- Can use React as a UI framework

<!--
Once again, my website is composed of Astro and React, both of which are hot topics these days.

Astro is an "all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.
By reducing JS execution on the client as much as possible, pages can be loaded at high speed.

# How to rotate

- Do your best with CSS
- And while we're at it, we'll make it zoom in and out (`scale`).
- Rotate only once, because infinite rotation is too much work.
- Add the following CSS class to the icon element

<br>

##### Example: CSS for an animation that rotates around the Z axis

```css
.rotate-animation-z {
  animation: rotate-anime-z 1.5s linear 1 /* animation name time curve iteration count */
}

/* Define an animation that rotates around the Z-axis */
/* Specify between 0% and 100%, respectively */
/* rotate is the rotation angle, scale is the scaling */
@keyframes rotate-anime-z {
  0% {transform: rotate(0deg) scale(1);}
  25% {transform: rotate(90deg) scale(1.5);}
  50% {transform: rotate(180deg) scale(1);}
  75% {transform: rotate(270deg) scale(1.5);}
  100% {transform: rotate(360deg) scale(1);}
}
```

<!--
How do we rotate it, though?
The rotation is done by defining the animation in CSS, defining the class to which the animation is applied, and then assigning it to the icon element.

The code below is an example of rotation around the Z axis.
-->

---
layout: default
---

# I want to rotate when I click.

- As it is, the page ends up rotating one revolution when it loads.
- It makes no sense to the viewer when it suddenly turns (and stops after one rotation).
- Rotate when clicked.
- Add CSS class on click (`click`), remove CSS class when animation ends (`animationend`, `animationcancel`)
  - If you don't remove the CSS class, it will only rotate on the first click.
- Use React's `useEffect` to register event listeners at load time

<!--
As it is, the page ends up rotating once when it loads, so we want it to rotate every time it is clicked.

In this case, we decided to rotate each click by adding a CSS class on click and removing the CSS class when the animation ends.

Since we are using React, we use `useEffect` to register an event listener when the page loads.

</div>

<!--
To change the direction of rotation with each click, define a new animation, define a corresponding class, and randomly assign the class.

It is fine to give a class randomly, but the class must be removed when the animation is finished.

Since the class is randomly determined in the handler of the click event, we do not know which class is applied in the handler of the animationend event.
So, within the handler of the animationend event, all animation classes should be removed.

# How to call the current component

- It calls `MyIcon` with the following structure
  - Astro (`index.astro`)

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TSX (`SelfIntroduction.tsx`)

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TSX (`MyIcon.tsx`)
- `MyIcon` is called from Astro and passed as a small element to the `SelfIntroduction` component
- The reason for not calling `MyIcon.tsx` from `SelfIntroduction.tsx` has to do with Astro properties

<br>

```tsx
<SelfIntroduction>
  <MyIcon
    client:idle
    iconPath={/* PATH to icon image */}
    iconClass="my-icon"
  />
</SelfIntroduction>
```

<!--
The `MyIcon` component that provides animation is called from Astro for a reason.
The reason for not calling `MyIcon` from the `SelfIntroduction` component responsible for the self-introduction part has to do with Astro's characteristics.
-->

---
layout: default
---

# Astro's philosophy is to minimize JS on the client

- Astro is a framework that does as much server-side rendering as possible, so it is designed to minimize JS execution on the client [^server_first].
- Thus, to get JS to run on the client, you must declare a `client:*` directive
- `client:idle`: load and hydrate the component's JavaScript after the page has initially loaded and the `requestIdleCallback` event has occurred [^client_idle].

<br>

Example (`index.astro`)
```tsx {3}
<SelfIntroduction>
  <MyIcon
    client:idle {/* it won't work without it */}
    iconPath={/* PATH to icon image */}
    iconClass="my-icon"
  />
</SelfIntroduction>
```

[^server_first]: https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/#server-first
[^client_idle]: https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientidle

<!--
As I mentioned at the beginning, Astro is built with the philosophy of minimizing JS on the client.
Therefore, if you want to execute JS on a client, you must declare a `client` directive for that component.

For example, `MyIcon` is given `client:idle`. Without it, it will not rotate.
-->

---
layout: default
---

# You have to apply `client:*` to `MyIcon`.

- `MyIcon` uses gory JS and requires `client:*` configuration
- `client:*` can only be called from `*.astro`.
- The effect of `client:*` extends to child components of the given component.

<br>

**Method**
1. grant `client:idle` per `SelfIntroduction`.

   Astro (`index.astro`)
  
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TSX (`SelfIntroduction.tsx`) `client:idle` ‰ªò‰∏é

            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TSX (`MyIcon.tsx`)
Give `client:idle` to `MyIcon` only (current method)
   
   Astro (`index.astro`)
  
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TSX (`SelfIntroduction.tsx`)

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TSX (`MyIcon.tsx`) `client:idle` ‰ªò‰∏é„ÄÇ`SelfIntroduction` „Å´Ê∏°„Åô

<!--
And since this `client` directive is an Astro feature, it can only be called from a `*.astro` file.

There are two possible ways to give `client`.
One is to give `client:idle` for each `SelfIntroduction`.
The other is to give `client:idle` to `MyIcon` and pass it to `SelfIntroduction`.
So far, we have implemented the latter method.

# Organizing so far

- Currently calling `MyIcon` from Astro and passing it to `SelfIntroduction`.
- This method does not give a uniform probability of animation, so we want to use one component and one element.
- Easier to make it 1 component 1 element by calling `MyIcon` from `SelfIntroduction`.
- but this method makes the drawing look strange.

<br>

- Using React's `useState` to make it manageable for multiple `MyIcon`s to handle multiple elements
- Convert `SelfIntroduction.tsx` containing `MyIcon` calls to `.astro` files.

- I used to use this method. I stopped while I was working on the documents.
- useState` and `useRef` to manage the current animation state of large and small icons respectively
- Only one animation class is now added for each large and small icon
- Complex structure
- (I was trying out some stuff at the time, but I can't remember why I needed `useRef`.)

<!--
As for how to do your best with `useState`, I actually used to work around the problem this way.
It was like using `useState` and `useRef` to manage the current animation of each large and small icon as a state.
It became quite complicated and I came up with another, simpler method, so I stopped while preparing this presentation material.

By the way, I don't remember why `useRef` was needed...

# Convert `SelfIntroduction.tsx` containing `MyIcon` calls to `.astro` files.

- As we were making the materials, we realized that this way was simpler and easier to explain, so we adopted it.
- Fixed `MyIcon` to be one component, one element.
  - Changed to a format where Id is passed from outside (initial contents of large icon looking around)
- Rewrite `SelfIntroduction.tsx` in `.astro` format
- Call `SelfIntroduction.astro` from `index.astro`.
- Call `MyIcon` from the newly created `SelfIntroduction.astro` and give `MyIcon` `client:idle

<!--
Yes, another way is to convert the `SelfIntroduction.tsx` containing the `MyIcon` call into an `.astro` file.
First, modify the `MyIcon` component to handle only one element.
Then rewrite `SelfIntroduction.tsx` in `.astro` format.

# Try turning it into a `.astro` file.

- What was good
  - Replacing `.tsx` with `.astro` was easy.
  - The `.astro` makes it simpler to implement if you want to dynamically execute JS.
- What's not so good
  - Cannot call `.astro` from `.tsx`.
    - You may have trouble in the future.
    - It would be good to keep only the parts that you actually want to be dynamic in `.tsx`, and wrap them in `.astro` for placement.

<!--
Try making an Astro file,

The good news is that switching from TSX to Astro was easier than expected, and the implementation was simplified by taking advantage of the Astro mechanism.

The only thing I found not so good is that Astro cannot be called from TSX, which may be a problem when you want to use it again in the future or when testing components.
However, I thought that it would not bother me too much if I kept the part of logic I wanted to test in TSX and wrapped it in Astro when deploying it.
In fact `MyIcon` is still TSX.

# Summary
- Can rotate images using CSS.
- If you want the animation to rotate with each click, you can add rotation CSS on click and remove it when the animation ends.
- If you want to rotate randomly, and for some reason want to place multiple components of the same image, and you are using Astro, you will have to twist your head.
- If you want to execute JS dynamically in Astro, be careful where you write `client:*`.
  - It would be nice to have `.astro` for the part that calls the dynamic component

Summary.

If you want to turn icons like I do, especially if you are using Astro, I hope you can help me with the implementation.

If anyone knows a better way, please let me know.
