<!--
Here is my self-introduction.
I am from Kagoshima, and my favorite foods are chicken nanban and spicy noodles.

I usually touch the back-end infrastructure and have almost no opportunity to touch the front-end in my work.
I don't know anything about the front end, so I apologize if I'm using the wrong terminology, etc.
